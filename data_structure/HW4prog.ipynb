    "Two binary trees are ***isomorphic*** if one of them can be reshaped into the other by swapping the left children and right children at some nodes and vice versa. For example, consider the two isomorphic binary trees $T$ and $T'$ in the following figure.  Trees $T$ and $T'$ are isomorphic because tree  $T'$ can be  reshaped into $T$ by swapping the children of the root $r$ and node $b$, respectively. Of course, a binary tree is isomorphic to itself.\n",

    "We have provided the function `readLines()` for reading lines from the text file and you then need to `re` package to parse each line for building the binary tree using ***linked structure***. For this, you need to implement the `node` and `binary tree` classes.\n",
